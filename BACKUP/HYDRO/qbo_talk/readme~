This is a wrapper for QBO robot from THE CORPORA
It uses Espeak and Mbrola to produce nice voice.
Actually it's in French, but it's easy to change :
	download your model voices, and change "fr_speak" line content to feet your need

It creates a service called /say

 When neo_talk is running, you can make QBO speak with this, in terminal command : rosservice call /say "Salut a tous"

Enjoy

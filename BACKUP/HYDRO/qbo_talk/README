# This is a Espeak wrapper for QBO robot from THE CORPORA
# It uses Mbrola to produce nice voice.
# Actually it's in French, but it's easy to change :
#	download your model voices, and change "fr_speak" line content to feet your need
#       ( replace "fr1" by "en" or "es"....)
#


Open a terminal :

sudo apt-get install espeak
sudo apt-get install mbrola

search on web for mbrola voices, you have very good voices english, spanish, french... Quite better than festival

this node creates a service called "/say"

 When neo_talk is running, you can make QBO speak with this, in terminal command : rosservice call /say "Salut a tous"

Enjoy

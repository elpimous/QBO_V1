sometimes, in speech synthesis, words are not correctly spoken, so...
The talk_dic_* helps you to automatically improve synthesis.

insert in talk_dic_* :
"the word you'd like to hear" ">" "the modified word that will be correctly heard"

IMPORTANT : be sure to make a space before and after ">" symbol (ex :vincent > vinssant)

For english, uncomment L56, and comment L54
